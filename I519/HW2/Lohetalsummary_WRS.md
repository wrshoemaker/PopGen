# Summary of Loh et al., 2012

### Will Shoemaker

The authors invoke the law of diminishing returns in their prediction of the future of bioinformatics. That is, the more we sequence, the less data we collect that looks unique. This applies for the size of individual datasets (i.e. the more you sequence a genome, the more redundant your dataset becomes). This trend can be exploited to allow for the creation of more analytically tractable algorithms that work on compressed data.
