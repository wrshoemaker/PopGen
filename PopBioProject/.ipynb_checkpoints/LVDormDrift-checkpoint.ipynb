    "The model used here is similar in many ways, however, some clarification is necessary to understand the math below. We are interested in the dynamics of a dormant subpopulation and an active population. We start with a population of $n_{A}$ active individuals and $n_{D}$ dormant individuals.  The active subpopulation reproduces at a rate of $b_{A}$ and both subpopulations reproduce at rates of $d_{A}$ and $d_{D}$. Dormant individuals do not have a rate of reproduction as they cannot reproduce. We allow for compeition at rates of either $c_{AD}$ or $c_{DA}$, depending on the equation."
