# Microbial seedbanks and their evolutionary implications

### Keywords: microbial seed-banks, experimental evolution, neutral theory

**Background:**

Resource limitation is a critical driver of ecological and evolutionary processes in managed and natural ecosystems. When energy and nutrients are in limited supply, individuals are at risk of not being able to meet the basic metabolic requirements to sustain processes required for life. As a result, many organisms have evolved life-history strategies to deal with starvation. In terms of sheer numbers and their core role in regulating global biogeochemical cycles, the organisms with the most diverse life-history strategies are those of microorganisms. Despite this key role, growing evidence suggests that most microorganisms persist in low-resource environments by entering a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity (i.e. dormancy), forming seed-banks.

The primary function of dormancy is to reduce the risk of extinction during periods when conditions are suboptimal for growth. It is well established that microbial dormancy has strong effects on physiology and community structure. However, we do not know how dormancy and conditions of extreme resource limitation affect the molecular genetic structure of microbial populations.

^ maybe replace the above paragraph with something about seed-banks? 

**Evolution and dormancy** 

In order to make predictions on how dormancy alters a population's evolutionary trajectory on the molecular level, it is useful to place it in a population genetic framework. A core feature 

A recently developed dormancy model adapts a known ecological model and decomposes a microbial population into active and dormant components. (Blath et al., 2014; Jones & Lennon, 2010). This model has been 

Start with wright-fisher, expand to two population model

However, the only model that examines the impact of dormancy on a Wright-Fisher (should I take the model and add a mutation component)? 

Given how central a role mutation has played in the debatees? on microbial populations entering a dormant state due to environmental stress, it is important to consider how mutation acts in a dormant population. 

In an idealized Wright-Fisher population, genetic variation is . However, in a Wright-Fisher . Therefore, absent all other demographic factors that violate Wright-Fisher assumptions, the expected genetic diversity increases when a population enters dormancy. 


we would predict that the expected genetic diversity increases 

**Hypotheses:**

Our null expectation is that if a dormant population is identical to an actively reproducing population in all aspects excluding binary division, that the dormant population will have a higher level of  
If a dormant population experiances a mutation

**Study System:**

To examine the evolutionary impact of the life-history strategy of dormancy I will be using an environmental isolate of *Janthinobacterium*, a genus that has been observed in nature to exhibit dynamics typical of a population with a seed-bank component(citation). Our research has shown that *Janthinobacterium* exhibits unique phenotypic transitions under conditions of starvation and harbors the dormancy-associated genes cstA, sspA, and sspB5 (5,6)

**Intellectual Merit:**

This study will merge recent developments in theoretical population genetics in a controlled environment designed to manipulate population demography. The evolutionary implications of dormancy has been well-understood in certain plants for many years. However, **dormancy has been long overlooked in microorganisms, a serious oversight given their capacity for rapid evolution and key role in the global biogeochemical cycle**
